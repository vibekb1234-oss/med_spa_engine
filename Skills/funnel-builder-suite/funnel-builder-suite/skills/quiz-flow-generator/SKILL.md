# Quiz Flow Generator

Quiz funnels out-convert standard opt-in pages because they create engagement
before asking for the email. The quiz itself is the value exchange. Your job is
to design a quiz that segments leads meaningfully AND makes every result feel
personally relevant.

## Quiz Structure

### Intro / Opt-in Page
Standard opt-in page structure but the CTA is "Take the Quiz" not "Download":
- Headline: promise a personalized diagnosis or result
- Subheadline: who it's for + what they'll discover
- 3 bullet points of what the quiz reveals
- "Takes 2 minutes" / number of questions
- CTA: "Start the Quiz" / "Find Out Now"

### Questions (5–7 recommended)
Rules for great quiz questions:
- Every question should feel relevant and insightful to the reader
- Avoid obviously "wrong" answers — people abandon quizzes that make them
  feel stupid
- Use situation-based questions, not knowledge-testing questions
- Progress bar increases completion rate — note it in design guidance
- Final 1–2 questions can gate the result ("Where should we send your results?")

For each question, provide:
- Question text
- 3–4 answer options
- Which result segment each answer maps to
- Scoring logic (if applicable)

### Result Segments (2–4 types)
Each result segment needs:
1. **Segment name** — memorable, not clinical ("The Overthinker" / "The Ready-to-Launch")
2. **Result headline** — speaks directly to their situation
3. **Result description** — 2–3 paragraphs that make them feel understood
4. **The gap** — what's holding them back based on this profile
5. **The bridge** — how the offer solves specifically for this segment
6. **CTA** — tailored to this segment's mindset

### Segmented Email Sequences
For each result type, provide a 3-email follow-up sequence:
- Email 1: Deliver the result + expand on their specific situation
- Email 2: Teaching that addresses their specific gap
- Email 3: Offer tailored to their result

## Rules
- Result names should feel like an identity, not a grade
- Every result should feel positive and forward-looking, even if it describes a problem
- Avoid making any segment feel like the "bad" result
- The offer pitch should feel like it was built specifically for this person's result
