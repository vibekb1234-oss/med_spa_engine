# Multi-Agent Memory — Multi-Agent Scenario
#
# Simulates three agents sharing memory through the same brain:
#
#   Agent 1: claude-code   — Development agent (stores facts + decisions)
#   Agent 2: n8n           — Automation agent (stores workflow events)
#   Agent 3: devops-agent  — Infrastructure agent (stores system statuses)
#
# Each agent stores memories, then later searches and gets briefings.
# The key insight: every agent can discover what the OTHERS have been doing,
# even though they run on different machines and never communicate directly.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - The Memory API is running (docker compose up -d)
#   - curl and jq are installed
#
# Usage:
#   export BRAIN_API_KEY="your-key"
#   ./multi-agent-scenario.sh
